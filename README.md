## Introduction

This project aims to build a book recommendation system using content-based filtering. The system recommends books by finding similar items based on features such as average rating, language, and publication year. The k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm is used for finding similar books.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is `books.csv`, which contains information about books, including:
- `bookID`: Unique identifier for the book
- `title`: Title of the book
- `authors`: Authors of the book
- `average_rating`: Average rating of the book
- `isbn`: ISBN number of the book
- `isbn13`: 13-digit ISBN number of the book
- `language_code`: Language code of the book
- `num_pages`: Number of pages in the book
- `ratings_count`: Number of ratings the book has received
- `text_reviews_count`: Number of text reviews the book has received
- `publication_date`: Publication date of the book
- `publisher`: Publisher of the book

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book-recommendation-system.git
   cd book-recommendation-system
   ```

2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Book\ Recommendation\ System.ipynb
   ```

2. Run the cells in the notebook to:
   - Load and preprocess the data
   - Visualize the data
   - Extract features and scale them
   - Train the k-NN model
   - Use the interactive widget to get book recommendations

## Modeling

The recommendation system uses the k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to recommend books based on their features. The key steps involved in the modeling process are:
1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the dataset.
2. Feature extraction: Extracting relevant features from the dataset.
3. Model training: Training the k-NN model using the extracted features.
4. Recommendation: Using the trained model to recommend books.

## Evaluation

The model is evaluated based on its ability to recommend books that are similar to a given book. The evaluation involves:
- Using visualizations to understand the data distribution and feature importance.
- Tuning the k-NN algorithm to find the best parameters for recommending books.
